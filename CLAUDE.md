# Reborn Wave Group — project rules

## Languages: English, 中文, Bahasa Indonesia — always all three

Every piece of text a member or staff user can see must exist in all three
languages. When you add or change any text — in the app, the admin panel, the
POS, the WhatsApp bot, push notifications or server replies — add/update the
English, Chinese and Bahasa versions in the same change. Never ship English-only
text.

- **App (client):** use `t("key", vars)` from `useTranslation()` (or
  `translate()` outside React) in `client/src/lib/i18n.ts`. Keys live in
  `client/src/lib/i18n/<area>.ts` (booking, games, home, venue, account, admin,
  pos, server) — every key needs `en`, `zh` and `id`. Format dates with
  `localeTag(language)`.
- **Server replies to the app:** `tr(req, { en, zh, id }, vars)` from
  `server/i18n.ts` (the app sends its language in the `X-Lang` header).
- **Push / in-app notifications:** `pick(await userLang(userId), { en, zh, id })`.
- **WhatsApp:** add a key to the `L()` table in `server/whatsappBot.ts` (or use
  the exported `waText`) and send it in `await langForPhone(phone, userId)` — a
  member's WhatsApp language follows their app language.
- **Game room messages** (`server/games.ts`) are shared by players with different
  languages: send a message key + values and translate on the client.

## Booking rules set by the admin

- `bookingTableDayLock` — a table booked at any time is closed for the rest of
  that day (app + WhatsApp).
- `bookingAskHours` — when off, the app and WhatsApp don't ask for hours and
  book 2 hours.
- `bookingAskSpecial` — when on, the app and WhatsApp ask for a special request
  (birthday, company event, anniversary, celebration + a note); it is saved on
  the booking. When off, the question is skipped.
